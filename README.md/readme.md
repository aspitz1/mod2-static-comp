# Overview 

This static composition is an exercise to explore HTML and CSS concepts. I explored symantic HTML with accessibly in mind
and learned the basics of SASS, as well as used CSS grid for the first time. The composition of the page is based off of
a page **[given in the rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/M2-static-comp-challenge.html)**. 
I was given some creative license with color choices, picture and text content and the option to use different assets 
where I was unable to find a close match.

# Lessons Learned

Over all this layout turned out to feel more complicated than I expected. On the `feature/base-layout` branch I attempted
to create graphs with pure CSS. Though I learned a lot about CSS grid in the process I ended up needing to scrap the idea 
for the sake of time. I used CSS flex-box for basicly all the layout, and I think in the future I will explore `disply: block`
if I am trying to do complicated css compositions like making graphs. I am not 100% sure but I think flex-box just made 
the layout too mushy for thay kind of accuracy. 

# What I Would Add
* Breakpoints for screen size
* Utilazation of of SASS functions for design patterns
* DRY up the CSS
* Continue to explore aria to make the page more accessible
